    <p> Airheads are made by creating long strips, similar to the method used to manufacture Play-Doh. The main ingredient is sugar. AirHeads prides itself for being one of the few candy that uses taffy, allowing it to be shaped in various ways. Other taffy-like candy include Bit-O-Honey, Abba-Zaba, and Laffy Taffy. They are a tangy, taffy-like, chewy candy manufactured by Dutch-Italian company Perfetti Van Melle in Erlanger, Kentucky. They were created August 7, 1985 by Steve Bruner. AirHeads are available nationwide in the United States. The candy is available in over 16 different flavors. </p>
